# WeatherMetrics

Weather Metrics is a git repo which will eventually contain an ASP.NET MVC CORE RESTful Web Service, Angular Web Front End, and an Azure IoT UAP Application that will run on Raspberry PIs.   This solution will eventually use an Azure IoT Hub so that the IoT UAP Applications running on Raspberry PIs will be able to push mock Weather Metrics Data to the IoT Hub and from there via an Azure Stream Analytics Job into a Azure SQL Server Database.  The ASP.NET MVC CORE RESTful Web Service along with the Angular Web Front End will allow end users to view Weather Metrics Data and also control the IoT UAP Applications running on Raspberry PIs.
